## Project Structure

```bash
src/               # React frontend
api/               # Serverless API routes
lib/               # Cloudinary, Supabase helpers
types/             # types
consts/            # Constants
```

## API Overview

### POST /api/videos/upload
- Uses @vercel/blob/client to generate upload tokens and upload directly to Vercel Blob
- Upon upload completed calls its onCompleted function to generate thumbnail and save metadata to Supabase

### GET /api/videos/list
- Returns a list of all saved video + thumbnail pairs from Supabase

## Notes
- Generating preassigned URL is the best practice to upload files but in Vercel requires to open a port locally for testing
- Vercel Blob is adding a generated id to every uploaded file which makes it impossible to predict the file name and it can not be turned off.
